# bash-recompiler
A simple bash script that pulls a requested version of Bash and compiles it within the shell. Great for testing privilege escalation exploits in outdated version of Bash within Unix environments.

Syntax: 
./recompile.sh -v <"version">

The -v version argument must be a valid version of Bash, as found at https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/
